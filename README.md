> The Next-Generation Computing Architecture



This is the community maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation computing architecture built by the PlatON Foundation.



## What is PlatON



PlatON is the next-generation global computing architecture and public infrastructure for a fully digitized age. In other words, we are the next-generation data plumbers and visionaries.



PlatON is therefore not a conventional blockchain technology system, but a service-oriented carrier for the coming future.



**PlatON is the computing factory and service marketplace of a fully digital age.**  It is a comprehensive service-oriented computing architecture that provides a distributed network framework, service framework, and an ecosystem for the liquidity of data. On PlatON, the computing power, algorithms and data are recognized as basic services, so it will be deployed as the infrastructure covers the full range of computation, storage and communication.  **With PlatON, let us compute**



**PlatON is the Tower of Babel for the Fully Digital World. **In addition to enabling distributed data exchange and collaborative computing for heterogeneous data from multiple sources, it also serves as a bridge for multi-source data and heterogeneous network infrastructure. PlatON surpasses existing value entities from a computation perspective and turns different types of resources and applications into services by constructing a distributed computing network using circuits as its basic components. Resources and applications are made into services, forming public infrastructures that transcend sections, services, accounts and entities. **With PlatON, maneuver data to flow.**



**PlatON is the sentinel posted at the entrance of the World of Algorithms.** It will be the first operating network in the world with complete privacy protection. PlatON insists that the data sovereignty of individuals and all entities are sacred and inviolable. PlatoN also believes that better privacy protection makes better data liquidity, which is enabled by the various algorithms in cryptography. **With PlatON, trust goes with an algorithm, while transaction goes with authentication.**



**PlatON is a super clearing house for data assets in the various industries and services,** which provide rating, evaluation and pricing services. PlatON has faith in the fundamental evolution of tokenization, driven by the exchange of data assets from all kinds of digitalized scenarios. PlatON supports a carrier-class business operation system which involves billing, payment, clearing, settlement and other operations. **With PlatON, all data liquidity goes with clearing and settlement.**



**PlatON network is improved by the co-evolution of software and hardware.** Hardware architecture will be launched to serve the needs of dramatically increasing computational complexity at the right time, making it more user-friendly. The power of our idea will be carried by the machine. **With PlatON, make computing easy. **



## Key Technologies



PlatON is based on the progresses of distributed computing,cryptography and blockchain technology over the past decades. It not only incorporates many of the ideas and technologies in blockchain but has also developed its own unique critical technological elements. These include the following:



**PlatON is a decentralized RPC framework.** PlatON implements a generic peer-to-peer service discovery mechanism which can be applied to RELOAD overlay network to provide dynamic service registry and discovery, transparent routing and access, service containers with multi-lingual support, as well service orchestration engine and service governance. The built-in services ,such as computing, data, storage and blockchain within each PlatON node, enable every user can also publish their own business services into PlatON network.



**PlatON provide a completely new computing model** to enhance blockchain perfomance, which implements linear computing scalability by decoupling computation from consensus, off-chain computing, and cheat-proof through Verifiable Computation (VC) algorithms, and high computing performance by parallel computing.



**PlatON supports a trusted data extension for blockchain.** It uses MPC algorithms to introduce data from multiple off-chain parties into smart contracts while guaranteeing their privacy. Computing channels with VC and time promises are employed to guarantee the validity of data.



**PlatON is a provable state transition function** based on Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) algorithms that eliminate the need for repeated execution of state transition functions by each node during the blockchain consensus and synchronization process. The correctness of the blockchain and transactions can then be rapidly verified.



### Computation as Contract



With the rapid development of mobile Internet, Internet-of-Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) ,data requirements have become increasingly precise and general. Thus the major challenge nowadays for large-scale complex computing is how to obtain computing resources and data in an effective manner.



**Large-scale computing lacks effective incentive.** Global public resource computing projects such as SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), IBM's World Community Grid (WCG), and Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) all aim to harness all idle computing resources for scientific research such as clean water supplies, cancer treatments, and clean energy. These global computing projects depend on the donation of computing resources by volunteers. They've only attracted small numbers of volunteers, however, as they lack effective means of encouraging the participation of idle computing resources around the world as well as the definition and execution of related rights and responsibilities.



**Large-scale computing brings new digital privacy concerns.** The rise of data sovereignty is making people aware of the value of data. They Even as people now enjoy the conveniences made possible by artificial intelligence technologies such as recommendation algorithms, voice recognition, image recognition, and autonomous driving, they have also become increasingly concerned about the sharing of their own data out of concerns for digital privacy.



We therefore propose the concept of **“computation as contract"** in response to this concern.



PlatON supports large-scale complex computation as contract. PlatON uses smart contracts to equip computation with corresponding legal and economic attributes. Computation can then be executed and incentivized on a self-organizing basis. Smart contracts can unleash the power of data by maintaining a high degree of data privacy while encouraging the full sharing of data.



### Contracts as computation



Smart contracts have the potential to support a greater range of application scenarios but are to date still hobbled by their platforms, but still face great challenges on performance and privacy issues.



PlatON takes an original approach by decoupling computation from consensus. The computation component of the contract is stripped out to make computing more efficient and safer. Features include:



- Computation essentialism



  All of the arithmetic logic in PlatON smart contract is compiled as boolean circuits, which is a return to the essence of computing.



- Computational parallelism



  The boolean circuits are used to break computation tasks into even smaller computational units. The units are then distributed to different computational nodes for computation to realize true parallel computing.



- Computational flatness



  The arithmetic logic based on boolean circuits is executed directly on computing specific hardware to skip over all intermediate steps.



- Computational privacy



  Leading cryptographic techniques including MPC, VC and ZKP are used to provide strong protection of user privacy, guarantee data security, and verify the correctness of computation results.



### Meta Smart Contract



An innovative Meta Smart Contract has been proposed by PlatON as a computation-oriented smart contract system for the computation world.



- Multi-source data support



  The meta smart contract supports the simultaneous viewing of chain upstreams and downstreams. The meta smart contract can be classified into stateful contracts, stateless contracts, and hybrid contracts according to sources of data.



- Data privacy protection



  Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE) are used to guarantee data privacy.



- Parallel computing



  PlatON breaks the arithmetic logic in the meta smart contract down into smaller computation tasks that are then distributed to different computational nodes for computing, providing high performance and linear scalability.



### Proof of Verifiable Computation



Mainstream blockchain technologies all still currently use consensus mechanisms such as PoW/PoS/DPoS, or their variations. All of these consensus mechanisms have the following problems:



- Waste of computing power



  The greater majority rely on hash mining. Everyone agrees that a great deal of computing power is wasted by this method. The mining mechanism's verification of transactions through local replay of the transaction process also wastes large amounts of computing power, resulting in excessively long consensus cycles that impact massively on blockchain performance.



- Centralization of computing power



  Statistics indicate that an invisible oligopoly effectively exists in Bitcoin and Ethereum as the top four and top three miners account for over 50% of their hash rate, respectively. This is at odds with Nakamotoi's original vision for Bitcoin.



Giskard is therefore proposed by PlatON as weighted proof of consensus mechanism based on VC algorithms.



- Decoupling computation from consensus



  To avoid the waste of computing power, computing power is only used for executing actual transactions rather than hash mining. The arithmetic logic of the transaction is broken down into even smaller computation tasks then distributed to different computational nodes for parallel computation through some inclusive strategies. Together with an effective governance structure and incentive plans, this will encourage the participation of all idle computing power worldwide in real computation. Power within the network is also decoupled and dissipated to avoid the centralization of computing power across the entire network. A dynamic balance between developer groups, computer groups, and data provider groups can then be achieved.



- Computation validation and transaction verification based on cryptography



  Every computation node carrying out computation tasks must submit a proof that is used for validating the computation result. The transaction result and its proof are placed directly in the blocks packaged by PlatON's consensus node. They can then quickly and effectively be verified by the verification node using cryptographic algorithms instead of replaying the transaction locally. Waste of computing power is avoided while also increasing the blockchain's overall consensus performance.



- Assessment of computational contribution and trustworthiness.



  In PlatON, computation tasks that pass verification accumulate the value of computing contribution for the computation node. The value of computing contribution is equivalent to trust ratings and their corresponding level. It is used to measure a computation node's contributions to computation and trustworthiness.



- Weighted election with the value of computing contribution.



  Consensus efficiency is increased in PlatON by using elections to select a small group of nodes for consensus building. PlatON wishes to encourage contributors of computing power and trustworthy computers, so the election is based on their computing contribution weighted stake. The number of votes possessed by each user is based on their computing contribution weighted stake. Consensus  candidates are generated through an election. Candidate rankings are also based on their computing contribution weighted stake.



- Block generation through PBFT consensus.



  Blocks are generated by the elected consensus nodes through optimized PBFT mechanism.



### Computing Specific Hardware



The arithmetic logic of smart contracts are compiled into boolean circuits in PlatON. The computation reverts back to the processing of AND, NAND, and XOR. Boolean circuit operations are a natural fit with the FPGA architecture. Converting the smart contract into FPGA Boolean circuits and executing these logical units through FPGA will greatly increase calculation efficiency and reduce power consumption/cost.

At an appropriate time，PlatON will release computing specific hardware based on FPGA/ASIC, which provide the massive transaction performance improvement of the entire blockchain, and operational hardware component of the next-generation computing architecture.



### Heterogeneous multi-chain architecture



The heterogeneous multi-chain architecture of PlatON means multiple application chains can be created to serve as sub-chains for specific application scenarios. The multi-chain architecture of PlatON has the following features:



- Unified user account



  Only one unified account in PlatON is needed for access to multiple application chains.



- Multi-chain sharing of resources

  Through embedded service discovery mechanism, the PlatON network publishes the basic computation, storage, data and routing services provided by nodes to the entire network. These services can be discovered and integrated by every application chain. In PlatON, the application chain itself is a service. Nodes on the network can discover and join any application chain.



- Multi-chain routing



  "Single access point for network-wide service" applies to blockchain services in the PlatON network. In other words, a PlatON user can send a transaction from any node on the network to any application chain without having to actually establish a direct connection with the target application chain node.



- Cross-chain asset branch



  Every application chain can issue its own stand-alone measurement system with assert. Transfer and exchange of assert can also be performed at will.



## Application Ecology



### Application System



PlatON will work to build a global value exchange network based on a next-generation computational architecture. We will build a global, cross-industry data exchange and collaborative computation infrastructure designed to meet mobility requirements in an Internet of Value age with data as assets. The network will encompass various vertical field such as finance, medicine, logistics, transport, broadcast, content, retail, business service, supply chain and other social benefiting fields.



PlatON will also continue to launch standardized services encompassing basic services such as certification, traceability, bonus point, reconciliation, clearing and settlement for the modularization of application services. This will in turn provide the foundation for the agile development of new application services.



### PlatON Union



PlatON will fully support PlatON-based unions by providing each application with end-to-end, deliverable infrastructure operation & management support and technical services.



Thanks to a production-level distributed computational architecture and world-leading cryptographic technologies, as well as a powerful business and technology management capability provided by a global partner network, PlatON partners are provided with distributed, scalable, and trustworthy data exchange and collaborative computation services, as well as data sharing with guaranteed data security and privacy protection.



Starting from the origin of distributed commercial infrastructure, PlatON continues to provide more comprehensive data exchange and transit clearing services for eco-level partners, from basic computing service iterations to generalized digital rights, digital certificates, and digital asset exchange infrastructure services . This includes a single credit account issuance and acceptance service model from the traditional centralized system, and a further transition to provide “super clearing house” services for full-account data across industry applications,data entities,application services, and network nodes.



### Open Ecology Building



PlatON is a flexible network that will uphold the principles of fairness, openness, and transparency for academic research institutions, developer communities, ISV/SP, data providers, algorithm and application providers, and computing power providers. We believe in the long-term, pro-active changes that a free market will bring.



We have faith in the power of the community because we believe that the redundancy and inspiration brought about by openness gives PlatON its basic reason and raw energy for existence in the long-term.



We will focus our efforts on combining the intelligence and energy of the community instead of trying to control everything and keep everything in-house.



We will embrace data sovereignty, privacy protection, and governance through the consensus of all parties instead of seeking control and dominance;



We will uphold the long-term mutual interests of the community, encourage the co-existence of moderate and reasonable economic benefits and incentives instead of profiteering and other improper short-term gains;



We will strive for compliance in every country and region around the world. We will comply with local laws and regulatory requirements while also doing our best to fit in with the unwritten laws and customs of the local society.



We will embrace the ideal of an open society in seeking acceptance and harmonious fusion in other regions.



## Privacy Protection and Regulatory Compliance



### Data Protection Regulation



Due to the introduction of the EU's strictest data protection regulation - General Data Protection Regulation, countries and regions have started to pay attention to or formulate relevant policies and regulations. PlatON will firmly uphold and support the national policy on personal data protection regulation. We will adhere to the concept of "personal and any entity data sovereignty are inviolable", and practice it through a variety of privacy protection algorithm and mechanism on PlatON platform.



### Regulatory Compliance of PlatON



According to the General Data Protection Regulation promulgated by the EU, it defines the roles including “data subject”, “data controller”, "data processor", "data receiver", "third party", and specifies all the responsibilities and obligations of the data controllers to the data subject. It stipulates the standards that data controllers and processors should follow in data processing and organization management. The regulations will not only make it costly for companies or institutions in different countries with personal data to make changes, but also affect many businesses that rely on personal data.



PlatON provides data controllers with a new data processing model -- collaborative computing with privacy protection. Different from the previous way of collecting and reprocessing data, PlatON's MPC algorithm can still perform collaborative calculation and get expected results without data leaving the local area. Unlike previous methods of data delegation processing that required data transfer to data processors, PlatON's meta smart contract could distribute computing tasks rather than data itself to the computing power providers for calculation.



PlatON will change a lot of enterprises from the "Data Controller" or "Data Processors" to the "Computation Requesters" or "Computing Power Providers" defined in PlatON. Enterprises are no longer obligated to own personal data, saving a lot of compliance costs; Part of the "Data Receivers" will also be transformed into the “Computation Requesters”. They no longer acquire the data, and only obtain results after collaborative computing. On the other hand, the scope of “Computation Requesters” or “Data Users” may expand under regulatory requirements, for example, cross-border collaboration will be possible; Meanwhile, since there is no need to worry about personal privacy is abused or leaked, individuals will also tend to authorize data to institutions for economic or non-economic benefits, the status of the "data subject" will be more firm and secure. Individuals will firmly grasp data sovereignty and disposition rights on their own. PlatON, as a "third party", will provide complete computing architecture and operation services for platform participants.



## Featured Cases



### Data Transaction



PlatON provides computation-based public infrastructure for data transactions around the world. Secure data exchange application chains and applications can be established to provide institutions and individuals with safe and reliable data exchange and collaborative computing services. These services help protect data privacy during data sharing and gain economic benefits without losing ownership. PlatON assists data owners and users in generating reasonable rates and prices during data transactions. 



### Global Scientific Computation



PlatON allows computation tasks to be broken down into distributed sub-tasks while encouraging and mobilizing idle computing resources around the world for scientific computation. The proper utilization of computing power allows scientific research organizations and commercial groups to engage in cheaper and more efficient scientific computations.



### Authentication



A decentralized identity management system, based on PlatON, solves problems of traditionally centralized systems such as “single point of failure”, the malicious collection and abuse of users’ private data. As PlatON is able to find the association between multiple identities, a complete user portrait profile can be pieced together through collaborative computing with privacy protection. Agencies will be able to identify their users more effectively and provide better services. A tamper-proof chain of identity authentication will then be created to contribute to the strengthening and transmission of trust.



### Medical Health



Medical heath and genetic data of individuals have the highest privacy requirements and largest amount of data types. An open service platform for medical information can be built on PlatON with a unified and general set of data exchange standards to make the connection of heterogeneous data among different organizations. This promotes the further analysis and application of medical and genetic data to make a global medical health database network. The PlatON client can also support sevices such as individual unified health account and medical data consortium.



### Credit Investigation System



Traditional credit investigation systems are now facing the classic "blind men and an elephant" problem due to limited sources of third-party data, unreliability of data models and constraints of data sharing. A distributed social credit system on PlatON, including privacy protection, will be able to integrate data from multiple sources, develop credit models for different scenarios, allow individuals to manage their own credit data and allow organizations to participate in joint credit investigation. All these reduce the credit cost of the whole society promoting construction of a global social credit system.



### Social Network



The next-generation social network built on PlatON supports peer-to-peer communication and data exchange across regions and application domains who enjoy the advantages over decentralization, privacy protection, data security and incentive compatibility. Users own all the data they generate. They can build up their personal credit, brand, and influence in the digital world through relative services such as depository certification and copyright registration. 



### IoT and Industrial IoT



PlatON can provide an infrastructure with data security and privacy protection for large-scale IoT network on the basis of a global computing power sharing platform, intergrating the capacity of edge computing, which boost the development of IoT applications in various industries such as smart manufacturing, Internet-of-Vehicles, agriculture, smart cities, and distributed energy management.
